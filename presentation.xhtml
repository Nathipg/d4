						<h3>Features</h3>
						<p>This application, which works as a database of notes, is commonly used to catalog and organize information given that it doesn't accepts only text format, but also various media resources such as photos, audios, videos and other, also it supports reminders and allows the user to save pages to read later online.</p>
						<p>One of its advantages is the portability, since it can be used in major operating systems found on the market, such as Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS and Windows Phone. It is noteworthy that the backup of all the annotations are saved in the cloud, so even if you lose your device, you can retrieve notes just login and synchronizing data.</p>
						<p>However, the feature that really stands out in this application is the search engine, which, although it seems simple, allows a note to be found from its creation date, type of media it contains and the geographical location where they were created. In addition, it also allowed the user to record the search terms that it may come to be used again.</p>
